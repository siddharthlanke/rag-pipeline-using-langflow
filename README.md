# rag-pipeline-using-langflow
In this repository I document the creation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Langflow. The pipeline enhances query results by combining powerful retrieval mechanisms with a large language model.

## Why Chose RAG
I wanted to create a system that answers complex, domain-specific questions accurately. 
By integrating retrieval with generation, this pipeline reduces hallucinations from language models and ensures responses are grounded in real data.

## Features of this RAG Pipeline
- A straightforward setup using Langflowâ€™s intuitive interface.
- Efficient document chunking and embedding generation.
- Seamless integration with AstraDB for embedding storage and retrieval.
- Generative capabilities(using llama3.2) enhanced with context-specific answers.
